## Git History Reconstruction

### 10-Step Development Path

1. **step_01**: Initial repository setup (README, .gitignore, requirements, LICENSE)
2. **step_02**: Core imports and plotting utilities (4 cells)
3. **step_03**: Logistic regression demo (7 cells)
4. **step_04**: Classification metrics exercises (12 cells)
5. **step_05**: Gaussian data generation (14 cells)
6. **step_06**: LDA/QDA theory documentation (16 cells)
7. **step_07**: LDA/QDA comparison implementation (18 cells)
8. **step_08**: Exercise prompts for analysis (20 cells - complete)
9. **step_09**: Documentation enhancement (full README)

## Project Identity

**Display Title**: Classification Methods Visualization: Logistic Regression, LDA & QDA

**Tagline**: Interactive visualization and comparison of classification algorithms on synthetic datasets

**Description**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) for binary classification with decision boundary visualization and performance comparison.

**Topics**: machine-learning, classification, logistic-regression, lda, qda, discriminant-analysis, data-visualization, scikit-learn, jupyter-notebook, decision-boundaries, supervised-learning

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Approach**: Phase-by-phase transformation with clear checkpoints
2. **Comprehensive Audit**: Pre-change documentation caught all issues
3. **Ledger Discipline**: Tracked every change with before/after snippets
4. **Incremental History**: Step-by-step snapshots created realistic narrative

### Key Success Factors
1. **No Feature Creep**: Strictly preserved original demonstration intent
2. **Behavior Preservation**: Only removed metadata, not functional code
3. **Documentation First**: Established identity before making changes
4. **Verification**: Tested syntax and validated at each step
