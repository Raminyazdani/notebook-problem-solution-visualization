Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Implement LDA classification

Added LDA application to the three Gaussian scenarios. Implemented LinearDiscriminantAnalysis classifier and created decision boundary visualizations for each covariance structure. Shows how LDA performs optimally on shared covariance (Scenario 2) with linear boundaries.
