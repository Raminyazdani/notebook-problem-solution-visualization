Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Implement QDA classification

Added QDA application to the three scenarios using QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis. Created decision boundary visualizations showing the quadratic (curved) boundaries that QDA can form. Demonstrates QDA's advantage on different covariance structures (Scenario 3) where it can capture more complex class boundaries.
