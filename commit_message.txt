Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Implement ellipse plotting utility

Added plot_ellipse() helper function to draw 2-sigma confidence ellipses for Gaussian distributions. The function computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of covariance matrices and uses matplotlib's Ellipse patch for clean visualization. This utility will be reused throughout the notebook for visualizing different covariance structures.
