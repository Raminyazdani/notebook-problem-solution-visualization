Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Add comparative analysis exercises

Added Exercise 4, 5, and 6 prompting users to analyze and compare LDA vs QDA performance across different scenarios. Questions guide learners to match covariance assumptions with classifier choice and understand when to use each method. All 20 notebook cells now complete.
