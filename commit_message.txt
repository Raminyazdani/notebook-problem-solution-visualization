Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Document LDA and QDA theory

Added markdown cells explaining the mathematical foundations of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). Described how LDA assumes shared covariance leading to linear boundaries, while QDA allows class-specific covariances creating quadratic boundaries. This theoretical background helps interpret the upcoming comparisons.
