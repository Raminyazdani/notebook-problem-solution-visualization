Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Enhance README with setup instructions

Significantly expanded README.md with professional documentation including: project overview, what it does (logistic regression, Gaussian exploration, LDA vs QDA), tech stack details, repository structure, comprehensive setup instructions with prerequisites, and multiple installation options. Added clear sections for how to run the project with three different approaches (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code).
