Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Generate Gaussian data with isotropic covariance

Created Scenario 1 demonstrating Gaussian-distributed data with isotropic (spherical) covariance structure using make_blobs. Both classes have the same circular spread. Added visualization with confidence ellipses to illustrate this symmetric covariance pattern.
