Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Import scikit-learn modules

Added scikit-learn imports: make_classification and make_blobs for synthetic data generation, LogisticRegression for classification, and LinearDiscriminantAnalysis/QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis for discriminant analysis. These imports establish all the ML capabilities needed for the demonstrations.
