Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Add binary prediction conversion and error analysis

Added Exercise 2 for converting probability predictions to binary class labels using 0.5 threshold. Implemented code to compute Type I (False Positive Rate) and Type II (False Negative Rate) errors, providing insight into the different types of classification mistakes the model makes.
