Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Add confusion matrix visualization (with typo)

Added Exercise 3 for visualizing correct vs incorrect predictions and implemented confusion matrix display with seaborn heatmap. Included Type I and Type II error rate calculations. **MISTAKE**: Used incorrect variable name 'y_tests' instead of 'y_test' when calling confusion_matrix(y_tests, y_pred_class), which would cause NameError at runtime. This is a realistic typo from quickly typing variable names.
