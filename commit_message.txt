Ramin Yazdani | Classification Methods Visualization | main | WIP: Fix variable name typo in confusion matrix

**HOTFIX**: Corrected the variable name from 'y_tests' to 'y_test' in the confusion_matrix call. The code now properly references the test labels variable. This fix was caught after attempting to run the cell and seeing the NameError. Demonstrates typical debugging workflow of catching simple typos during testing.
